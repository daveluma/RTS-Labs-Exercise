## Part 1

Contains two input fields for the user to enter.

>- First input is for the array of integers seperated by commas i.e. 1,5,2,1,10
>- The second input is for the integer value to compare.

The output will display the count for numbers less than the input integer and count for the numbers greater than the input integer.

i.e. array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4".


## Part 2

Contatins two input fields for the user to enter as well.

>- First input is for the string the user wishes to rotate
>- Second input is for the number of rotations desired on the said string.

The output should shift all the characters of the string by the number of rotations inputted by the user. i.e. string: “MyString” rotations: 2 would output “ngMyStri”.


## Part 3

Just my favorite language and one thing I would like changed about it.
>I love Python due to the user friendly libraries, but I wish it was as fast as C/C++. If I could I would like Python to have 
    the speed of a low level language.
